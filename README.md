# VSAP Performance Analysis

## The VSAP Plan for Outcome Measurement

### Introduction

VSAP was created to diagnose, assess, referr or educate, and monitor substance 
use cases referred from the judicial system.

As addiction is a chronic illness most patients with addiction will require 
chronic care. Therefore the outcomes will be designed to measure success in 
chronic disease treatment.


### What We Do

Clients arrive undiagnosed and unassessed. The assessment will take into 
account the presence or absence of illness, the social context of the patient, 
and other factors to arrive at a suggested solution for the patient's problem.

Both clients who are ill and those who are not seek a solution for 
the problem they are experiencing, namely legal consequences of 
substance use. The assessment will determine if illness is present. If treatment 
for illness is required, referral is made. If no illness is present, the client
is offered an educational solution.

The patient may or may not accept the offered solution, and it is part of 
program to continually monitor the patient for the need for different solutions
and to help motivate the patient to accept that solution. If illness becomes
apparent during education, referral is made then.

Finally, we monitor the patient from first referral to completion and beyond. 
Monitoring serves two purposes. It serves as a tripwire for recognition of resumption
of symptoms and the need for intervention. It also allows us to gather data
to improve our ability to provide effective solutions. 


### What We Measure

In both education and chronic disease management we can choose to measure 
several factors. But the most important is retention. 

Clients cannot receive education or treatment if not retained. Retention can 
be considered as an outcome of the correctness of diagnosis and assessment 
which determines the solution and readiness of the client. If treatment is 
poorly matched with client goals, retention will be lowered. Likewise, if 
treatment fails to meet the patient's needs, retention will be lowered.

Assuming that the treatment offered is accurate based on the aforementioned
factors, we now turn our focus to adherence. Clients will not adhere to treatment
