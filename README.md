# VSAP Performance Analysis

## The VSAP Plan for Outcome Measurement

### Introduction

VSAP was created to diagnose, assess, referr or educate, and monitor substance 
use cases referred from the judicial system.

As addiction is a chronic illness most patients with addiction will require 
chronic care. Therefore the outcomes will be designed to measure success in 
chronic disease treatment.


### What We Do

Clients arrive undiagnosed and unassessed. The assessment will take into 
account the presence or absence of illness, the social context of the patient, 
and other factors to arrive at a suggested solution for the patient's problem.

Both clients who are ill and those who are not seek a solution for 
the problem they are experiencing, namely legal consequences of 
substance use. The assessment will determine if illness is present. If treatment 
for illness is required, referral is made. If no illness is present, the client
is offered an educational solution.

The patient may or may not accept the offered solution, and it is part of 
program to continually monitor the patient for the need for different solutions
and to help motivate the patient to accept that solution. If illness becomes
apparent during education, referral is made then.

Finally, we monitor the patient from first referral to completion and beyond. 
Monitoring serves two purposes. It serves as a tripwire for recognition of resumption
of symptoms and the need for intervention. It also allows us to gather data
to improve our ability to provide effective solutions. 


### What We Measure

In both education and chronic disease management we can choose to measure 
several factors. But the most important is retention. 

Clients cannot receive education or treatment if not retained. Retention can 
be considered as an outcome of the correctness of diagnosis and assessment 
which determines the solution and readiness of the client. If treatment is 
poorly matched with client goals, retention will be lowered. Likewise, if 
treatment fails to meet the patient's needs, retention will be lowered.

Assuming that the treatment offered is accurate based on the aforementioned
factors, we now turn our focus to adherence. Clients will not adhere to treatment
if they perceive it as not meeting their needs. In addiction treatment,
a key measure of adherence to the care plan is abstinence from using drugs or compulsive
behavior to alter their mood or mind.

Assuming the client is getting better with treatment, symptom resolution is a 
core outcome measure. VSAP measures the primary symptoms of addiction that have been
included in our assessments. In implementing symptom resolution, we
cannot ignore the progressive nature of the illness. Primary addiction is a 
chronic progressive illness, and while permanent lack of progression is
impossible, it is the goal of all chronic disease treatment to maintain survival
until the patient dies of some other cause. Lack of progression will
largely be measured during monitoring using the same VSAP Symptom Score mentioned
above.

Chronic diseases cause sequelae. In diabetes it is such things as vascular disease 
and vision loss. In addiction the sequelae include such things as trouble with the law, 
increased healthcare costs, loss of work, or underemployment. We will 
measure the sequelae or lack of them.

With treatment comes life extension, so we will measure longevity. As
logevity is a very long term measurement, its inverse, mortality,
is used as a proxy.

Quality of life factors are also critical. It makes no sense to extend life
if it is not enjoyed. Measurements such as arguemnts at home, helathcare, 
and expansion of personal relationships can be used as measures of 
quality of life.

In any chronic illness symptoms may reemerge after they are suppressed. 
Our monitoring will meassure relapse of symptoms using our Symptom Score.

Finally, all of these measures can be turned into a ratio by dividing
by the cost of care used to attain them. This will give us a 
measure of cost effectiveness of treatment.

In general, because we will not have specific end points, our 
primary statistical methodology will be that of repeated meausures 
and survival analysis. We will use other toools as well to elucidate 
the connections and correlations between our outcomes and many will 
interact.

NB: There is a VSAP portal designed to keep these outcomes
