# VSAP Performance Analysis

## The VSAP Plan for Outcome Measurement

### Introduction

VSAP was created to diagnose, assess, treat, and monitor substance use cases
referred from the judicial system.

It is also assumed that most patients with addiction will require chronic care.
Therefore the outcomes will be designed to measure success in chronic disease 
treatment.


### What We Do

Patient do not arrive at our door pre-dagnosed and are immediately assessed. The
assessment will take into account the presence or absence of illness, the
social context of the patient, and other factors to arrive at a suggested
solution for the patient's problem.

Both patients who are ill and those who are not will present themselves for a 
solution to the problem they are experiencing, namely legal consequences of 
substance use. The assessment will determine if illness is present.

The patient may or may not accept the offered solution, and it is part of 
treatment to continually monitor the patient for the need for different care and to 
help motivate the patient to get that care.

Finally, we monitor the patient from referral to completion and beyond. Monitoring
serves two purposes. It will serve as a tripwire for recognition of resumption
of symptoms and the need for intervention, and it will allow us to gather data
to evaluate our core functions as well as our ability to provide effective treatment
services. 


### What We Measure

With chronic disease we measure several factors, the first of which is retention.
Patients cannot receive treatment is not retained in treatment. Retention can be
considered as an outcome of the correctness of diagnosis and assessment which
determines treatment. If treatment is poorly matched with patient goals, retention 
will be lowered. Likewise, if treatment fails to meet the patient's needs, retention
will be lowered.
